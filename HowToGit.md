# How to set up and use Git

## Setup
* In the command line, cd to the directory where you want to have a working copy of the eclipse workspace.
* type 'git clone https://git.cs.bham.ac.uk/robotics-group4-o4/assignment1', it will now copy the repository from the gitlab server to your local directory.
* type 'git remote add origin https://git.cs.bham.ac.uk/robotics-group4-o4/assignment1', this sets a shortcut for the url to the variable 'origin'
